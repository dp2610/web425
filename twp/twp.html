        <h2 id="preface">Preface: Why Haven’t I Already Let These Go?</h2>

        <p>
          This week, as I went through the things I was finally getting rid of, I realized how many of them
          had been sitting in the back of my closet or drawers for years. I didn’t keep them because I
          needed them, but because I wasn’t ready to let go of what they represented. Throwing something
          away is usually quick and automatic, but this week felt different. Each item I picked up brought
          back memories I hadn’t thought about in a long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of what I’m letting go of this week comes from earlier parts of my life. These weren’t
          objects I used recently, but they stayed with me quietly as I grew older. I think part of me knew
          they still mattered, even if I didn’t look at them often. Writing about them now feels like
          finally acknowledging that hidden value before moving on.
        </p>

      <section class="content-section" aria-labelledby="overview">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview: How These Items Ended Up Here</h2>

        <p>
          When I started choosing items to throw out this week, I noticed a clear pattern. I kept reaching
          for things that had been pushed aside but never fully forgotten. These were items that once had a
          lot of value in my life and slowly lost their everyday use, but not their meaning. I held onto
          them because I wasn’t ready to throw away the memories attached to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I looked through everything, the items fell into three stages of my childhood. Each group
          connects to a different time in my life, and each one reminded me why I kept these things for so
          long.
        </p>

        <h3>Everyday things I relied on</h3>
        <p>
          The first group includes my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glasses</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wired headphones</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPad case</a>, which connect to my later
          childhood, especially around middle school and the beginning of high school. These were items I
          used almost every day. The glasses are the pair I wore throughout my school days, and so many
          memories from that time are connected to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The iPad and its case were especially important because it was my first electronic device from my
          parents. I used it for schoolwork, watching videos, playing games with friends, and relaxing after
          long days. The wired headphones go along with that time too, I used them on bus rides, while
          doing homework, or whenever I needed music to calm myself down during stressful moments. These
          items are worn out now, but they represent a time when they were part of my daily routine.
        </p>

        <h3>The fun side of growing up</h3>
        <p>
          The second group includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(gridiron_football)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controller</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">board game set</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hat</a>, which connect to my teen age years
          of childhood during late elementary school and middle school. This group represents the fun part of growing up which includes
          playing outside, hanging out with friends, and doing activities with family.
        </p>

        <p>
          The football reminds me of playing outside after school or just being active with friends. The
          controller and board game set bring back memories of game nights and spending time indoors with
          friends and family. Those years of having fun and not overthinking everything really stuck with
          me, and seeing these items again brought those memories back. The hat ties into this group because
          I used to wear it when we would go out and it was sunny, especially on trips, park days, or any
          outdoor activities.
        </p>

        <h3>The little kid comforts</h3>
        <p>
          The final group goes back to my earliest childhood, around the years before and during kindergarten.
          This includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_toy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stuffed toy</a>
          and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cup</a>. These were things I used to
          love as a little kid, and they were part of my everyday life back then.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stuffed toy reminds me of being attached to comfort objects when I was young. I used to keep
          it close, sleep with it, and carry it around because it made me feel safe. The cup was also one of
          my favorites as a child. I remember my mom telling me I would refuse to drink water unless it was
          from that specific cup. These items may look worn now, but they remind me of how simple things
          used to feel so important.

        <p>
          This project was inspired by artists and researchers who examine trash not as something meaningless, 
          but as evidence of human behavior, memory, and consumption. Their work shows that discarded objects 
          can tell stories about identity, culture, and the values we place on material things. Reading about 
          these individuals helped me think more carefully about what I throw away and why those items mattered 
          to me at one point in my life. If you want to explore similar ideas, these sources are a great place 
          to start.

        <p>
          Thank you for coming along with me this week of trash disposal. I kept pushing these items back in
          my closet because I wasn’t ready to get rid of them, but looking back now, even though they hold
          memories for me, it’s time for me to move on and make new ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of these items are still good and can be useful to someone else, so I hope to donate what I
          can, and that some kid can make good memories as I did with them. Thanks again for reading and
          coming along with me on my trash disposal journey.
